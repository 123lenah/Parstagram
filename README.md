# Parstagram

This is an Instagram clone with a custom Parse backend that allows a user to post photos, view a global photos feed, and add comments!

## User Stories
Upon first launch, the user can sign up to create a new account. Once logged in, a user stays logged in across restarts. The user can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to the Parse server. At the main page, the user can view the last 20 posts made by users on the app.
